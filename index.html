Complete challenges and win gear to fight the Ender Dragon!
Be careful though, several amongst you are traitors looking to sabotage the team and prevent you from killing the Dragon. 

After each challenge, people will vote on who they believe are the traitors, and there will also be mid-round interviews with participants.
Kind of like Survivor.

Proximity voice chat plug-in will be enabled!

Innocent win by successfully killing the Ender Dragon, while traitors win if the innocent fail to do so.
       
       
       This will <b>NOT</b> be streamed, but made into a video.

          <ol class="ol1">
              <li>The majority of players are innocent, while several are traitors. It is the goal of the innocents to complete challenges to get good gear as rewards, vote out traitors, and eventually defeat the ender dragon. The traitors are aiming to sneakily sabotage the innocents, while potentially killing here and there to prevent them from defeating the ender dragon. Be mindful though, as the kill feed will show if you kill someone directly. Traitors must be creative with how they kill people, and think of alibis.</li>
              <li>After every challenge, we will have a discussion period where people will be able to discuss what happened, who died, and any suspects. After a certain amount of time, people will be able to vote one by one on who they think is suspicious, or they can vote to abstain. If a player receives more than half of votes, they will be "voted off the island"</li>
              <li>After each discussion period, I will pull a few of you guys away to do quick little interviews and just get some insider info for the video</li>
              <li>If a challenge does not get completed, no one will get anything.</li>
              <li>Traitors will be given secret coordinates to chests with items that will help them in their efforts.</li>
              <li>Traitors will also be able to discuss whisper to one another to coordinate, but innocents are not allowed under any circumstances. You're recording your perspective with the mod, so I'll know if you cheat 🙂</li>
              <li>Chat is not to be used, except for during discussion periods.</li>
              <li>Do not forget. If you die, you are dead for good. You go to spectate mode and still can watch, but do NOT type or cheat for friends.</li>

            <h1 class="rule"><b>The rules are simple, but they heavily rely on your honesty.</b></h1>
            
            <ol class="ol2">
                <li>Please do not use chat unless it's during the discussion period. If you die, do not type anything. If you are being attacked, do not type anything. Wait until the discussion period, or yell at someone if you run into them. If you do not have a mic, carry a sign and try to get their attention. Speaking in chat at an incorrect time or exposing a traitor (especially after you die) can potentially ruin the game for everyone.</li>
                <li>Turn off discord sounds for voice channels. It is imperative that you guys do not know who is near you/joining your calls. Please follow the how-to on the <b><a href="https://discord.gg/y2jQFUCnXD" target="_blank">#minecraft-set-up</a></b> channel.</li>
                <li>No whispering unless you are a traitor. Traitors will be notified of each other and allowed to discuss with one another.</li>
                <li>Record your gameplay! Unfortunately due to the conflict of server types, we cannot have the replay mod and the proximity voice chat plug-in together, so we are going to require you guys to record your gameplay as well. After every challenge, I'll get you to end and start a new recording. This will ensure we get every moment possible if we are unable to get it ourselves! Additionally, it will show if you cheat. So, again, do not cheat.</li>
                <li>If anyone is cheating, please let me know asap via discord message. We really want everyone to have fun and hope that we can trust you guys to do more stuff like this in the future! So please let me know asap.</li>
                <li>If you cheat, you will be outright banned from everything without question. We have put too much time into this event for you guys, and it would be too disrespectful to overlook. Please do not cheat. There is no reward if you win. Have fun and enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played. If you play properly, you'll be happily invited to future events!</li>
                <li>Please have fun and understand that this is just a game. Do not take things too personally if you get voted off, killed, sassed.. etc. If this goes well, we will definitely do it again with different challenges so you'll get another chance. Enjoy the banter and friendly teasing.</li>
                <li>The same TOS rules from stream apply to this game</li>
